  Problem Statement-Investors struggle to make informed stock decisions due to the vast amount of financial data, complexity of indicators, and difficulty in interpreting market trends. The lack of accessible tools providing comprehensive insights into a company's industry and future trends further complicates accurate stock assessments, often leading to suboptimal investments.

However, the sheer complexity and volume of this data often lead to suboptimal decision-making, especially when insights into industry trends and company-specific factors are overlooked.
